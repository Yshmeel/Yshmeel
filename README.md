- JavaScript
- Java
- Python
- Golang

And frameworks/libraries, that i use mostly:

- React.js (as primary frontend framework)
- Next.js (if my frontend project needs to be SSRed, but sometimes i preffer to do manual SSR (make my own server to render React app))
- React Native
- Socket.io (for websockets, but sometimes preferred to send sockets over SSE, depends on requiremenets)
